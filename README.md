# We.Care - Healthcare Finder Landing Page ü©∫

We.Care is a responsive landing page for a fictional healthcare services platform. This project is a front-end implementation based on a modern Dribbble design, built entirely with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The focus was on creating a clean, professional, and interactive user experience using only foundational web technologies.

## ‚ú® What is This?

This project is a static website designed to showcase a landing page for a healthcare provider search platform. I built this to practice translating a high-fidelity UI design into a functional website without relying on any front-end frameworks like React or Vue.

Every interactive element‚Äîfrom the navigation menu to the dynamic content sliders‚Äîis powered by vanilla JavaScript and modern CSS. The site dynamically populates its sections with data from local JavaScript files, simulating a real-world application where content would be fetched from an API.

### Core Features

* **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is built with a mobile-first approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Dynamic Content Sliders:** The "Popular Searches," "Specialists," and "Patient Feedback" sections are powered by **Splide.js**, a lightweight and dependency-free carousel library. Content is loaded dynamically from local data files.
* **üîÑ Interactive Tabs:** The "Popular Searches" section features interactive tabs that, when clicked, dynamically repopulate the carousel with the relevant data for that category (e.g., Specialities, Conditions).
* **ü§ù Dynamic Content Rendering:** All content for the various sections is generated by vanilla JavaScript, which reads from data arrays in separate `.js` files and creates the necessary HTML elements on the fly.
* **üé® Modern CSS Styling:** The project utilizes modern CSS features, including `clamp()` for fluid typography, CSS Grid for complex layouts, and custom properties (variables) for a consistent color scheme.
* **üçî Slide-out Mobile Menu:** A fully functional slide-out navigation menu for smaller screens, managed with JavaScript event listeners.

## üîß Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built from scratch with a focus on core web technologies to demonstrate strong foundational skills.

* **Core Technologies:**
    * **HTML5**
    * **CSS3** (including Flexbox, Grid, and Custom Properties)
    * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Carousel Library:** **Splide.js** for creating the interactive content sliders.
* **Icons:** Font Awesome

### Architectural Highlights

1.  **Modular JavaScript Structure**
    The application's logic is organized into separate JavaScript files based on functionality (`menu.js`, `slider.js`, `reviews.js`, etc.). These scripts are responsible for handling a specific part of the page, from managing the navigation menu's state to dynamically building and controlling the content sliders.

2.  **Data-Driven Content**
    Instead of hardcoding content in the HTML, the site's data (for popular searches, staff members, and patient reviews) is stored in separate JavaScript files (`popular_searches.js`, `staff.js`, etc.). The main scripts import these data arrays and dynamically generate the corresponding HTML elements. This approach mimics a modern front-end workflow and makes the content easy to update.

3.  **Splide.js for Carousels**
    The project leverages Splide.js, a powerful and lightweight carousel library, to create the interactive sliders. The `slider.js` file initializes multiple Splide instances with different configurations for each section. The `popular.js` script demonstrates how to dynamically add and remove slides from a Splide instance when the user clicks on the filter tabs.

4.  **CSS with BEM-like Naming**
    The CSS is structured using a BEM-like methodology (e.g., `.hero__wrapper`, `.hero--left`, `.hero__title`), which makes the styles predictable, modular, and easy to maintain.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

This is a static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-website-landing-page.git
    cd medical-website-landing-page
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    * You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    * For the best experience (to avoid potential issues with local file paths), it's recommended to use a simple live server. If you have VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great choice.
