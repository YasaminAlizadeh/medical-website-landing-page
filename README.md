# Medical Website Landing Page

This Medical Website Landing Page is a personal project designed to showcase my web development skills. It has been developed using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The platform features a carousel to showcase staff members and patient reviews, tab changing to display different sections, and cool CSS animations to enhance the user experience. The landing page is also fully responsive and functional, with a newsletter subscription form to keep users updated on the medical website's services and news.

Thank you for checking out this project!
